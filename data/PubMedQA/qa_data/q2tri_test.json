        "answer": "Within the German health care system, in patients with a social insurance, PCI of long and complex lesions with PES significantly reduces costs as compared to CABG to the amount of 4,574 Euro per patient. The cost-effectiveness analyses of currently ongoing prospective, randomized trials (SYNTAX und FREEDOM) will provide more insight into the economic comparison of PCI with DES and CABG.",

The results add support to evidence suggesting that urodynamic assessment is not a prerequisite for the treatment of overactive bladder (OAB).

With precise preoperative planning of the resection and accurate execution of the procedure, the hip-sparing approach through partial acetabular resection can be performed in selected patients with malignant periacetabular neoplasms. Navigation makes it possible to minimize the amount of bone resection. In this preliminary report of a small number of patients, we had adequate short-term local tumor control. We believe the function is good, but we do not have a comparison group of patients to document improved function.",

        "answer": "We found a comparatively high prevalence rate of chlamydia-positive patients (11.4%) in our publicly funded pregnancy termination clinic. Because of infrequent follow-up in this patient population, we suggest screening and providing the epidemiologic treatment for CT genital infection for all women undergoing a same-day abortion procedure. It may prove cost-effective. Our prevalence rate of gonorrhea was lower (2.6%). The value of providing epidemiologic treatment for gonorrhea to all patients undergoing a same-day abortion procedure should be reexamined in controlled trials.",

Although the RIOE group had fewer postoperative anastomotic complications, due to the small sample size, the 5.7-fold increase in anastomotic failure did not translate into significantly better postoperative outcomes than the SIOE group experienced.

Consequently, Minimum Clinically Important Differences using raw data, or change scores in general, are invalid as these will either under- or overestimate true change; raw pain VAS data should not be used as a primary outcome measure or to inform parametric-based Randomised Controlled Trial power calculations in research studies; and Rasch analysis should be used to convert ordinal data to interval data prior to data interpretation.",

The 160 mg dose is effective only for children weighing 10.9 kg. Individual differences in drug bioavailability, volume of distribution, and absorption/elimination constants undoubtedly exist, and future studies directly measuring plasma APAP concentration and pharmacokinetics are needed. However, these results indicate that dosages for APAP in children should be weight based and manufacturers should review their dosing recommendations.",

The SHFM may facilitate identification of high-risk patients to evaluate for potential LVAD implantation by providing an estimate of 1-year survival with medical therapy.",

The cost of data collection and analysis is likely to fall, although further work is required to improve the validity of routine data, particularly in central returns. Better knowledge of the capability of local systems and access to the data held on them is also essential. Routinely captured clinical data have real potential to measure patient outcomes, particularly if the detail and precision of the data could be improved.",

However, biomedical publications without definite statements of ethical considerations remain common, and this continues to be seen in Chinese journals. It is imperative that measures are taken to reinforce the ethical protection in clinical trials in China.",

A diagnosis of atrophic pattern is indicative of low numbers of neutrophils. As the Papanicolaou test diagnosis of atrophic vaginitis does not correlate with clinical symptoms, a single diagnostic term that does not suggest a disease process would more reliably communicate cytology findings to clinicians.",

Further research can establish which skills correlate with medication adherence and active collaboration with the medical team. The present study also exposes important gaps in medication risk knowledge and may allow improved patient education for subgroups of adult patients with IBD.",

        "answer": "Although patients with HCV generally had higher rates of discontinuation due to TOXPC compared with patients without HCV, there was little evidence to suggest that this was associated with any specific nucleoside pair or third drug used as part of cART. Our results do not suggest that any specific component of cART is more poorly tolerated in patients with HCV or that the presence of HCV should influence the choice between antiretrovirals used as part of a cART regimen.",

        "answer": "We found no evidence for an influence of cCMRO2 on acute-stage neurological deficit or for a role of the unaffected hemisphere in early recovery after acute MCA ischemic stroke. The decline in unaffected-hemisphere metabolism from the acute to the subacute stage in the face of overall clinical recovery appears clinically irrelevant. The fact that the neocortical cCMRO2 at PET2 tended to be lower, and declined significantly from PET1 to PET2 in the mirror region in the subgroup of patients with large infarcts, suggests that this delayed effect represents transcallosal fiber degeneration.",

        "answer": "Syphilis in pregnant women in Francistown has been decreasing for the last 6 years, despite extremely high HIV prevalence (stable at>or =40% since 1996) in the same population. Reasons contributing to the decline in syphilis rates may include nationwide implementation of syndromic management of sexually transmitted diseases (STDs) in 1992, improved access to health care, and less risky sexual behaviour. There is evidence from other sources indicating that risky sexual behaviour in Botswana has decreased during the HIV epidemic.",

As only a marginal decrease was observed in the total population of medical and surgical patients, and only on the night shift, formal and standardized guidelines for the most efficient use of pulse oximetry should be considered. If these were considered, pulse oximetry may indeed make a significant contribution to improving the efficiency of care services.",

        "answer": "The declaration to national poison centers of these intoxications should be pursued by emergency pediatricians, physicians, and pediatric intensivists. Family physicians can encourage parents to declare adverse effects to the National Consumer Product Safety Commission. Parents need to be better informed of the risk of laundry pods and strictly keep this type of product out of the reach of children. Given that it took 7 years after the first warning by the French poison centers to obtain safety recommendations for manufacturers, it is important to maintain pressure on companies to obtain the necessary modification of the physicochemical properties and child-resistant packaging.",

Changes in corneal epithelium and endothelium detectable by confocal microscopy suggest a small toxic effect. These in vivo measurements by confocal microscopy were confirmed by SEM. Repeated administration did not cause additional cumulative toxic effects in the anterior segment. Therefore, multiple injections of 5- FU into the filtering bleb pose minimal risk to intraocular structures.",

More than one-half of the patients who had presented with an insensate foot that was treated with limb reconstruction ultimately regained sensation at two years.

Mainly owing to untimely diagnostic reports, time-to-diagnosis was longer in QDU patients. Cost-savings in QDU were substantial. Using objective tools to evaluate the condition severity and general health status of FUN patients could help decide the most appropriate setting for their diagnostic study.",

        "answer": "Multiparity caused morphometric changes in pubococcygeus muscle but not in bulbospongiosus muscle. As OR expression was high for both muscles, some properties related to fibre composition or muscle physiology could be affected. The finding that serum oestradiol was not elevated at the end of the fourth pregnancy could be related to changes in pelvic and perineal muscles associated with multiparity.",

These findings in patients with longer-existing asthma concur with other findings in newly detected asthma. We suggest that institution of inhaled CS therapy should not be postponed in asthmatics with documented airways obstruction and reversibility.",

        "answer": "Techniques that commit to urethral plate transection are criticized because they preclude using the urethral plate. In our study presence of SSS was predictive for the need to transect the plate. Obviously one can decide to keep the urethral plate at all cost, and mobilize it more than we did, or accept more residual curvature, but in reality our aim was to determine a preoperative marker allowing us to define a patient category. We believe presence of SSS is a marker of severity, and that this \"severity\" translates into \"a less usable urethra\". As recent studies caution us about the evolution of the reconstructed native urethra and the possibility that it may not grow as well as the other penile tissues, we believe this extra information could influence the surgeon's decision as to the most appropriate technique for each patient.",

Personality-based clusters did not correspond overall to clinical symptoms but aetiological differences supported their validity. Broader personality pathology indicative of emotional dysregulation, problems with identity and relationships, in addition to core traits, may increase vulnerability to AN in those with less familial risk.",

Otherwise, in patients with IC intussusception and no sign of peritoneal irritation, hydrostatic or pneumatic reduction is indicated. When this fails, surgery is the next step.

Routine diuresis renogram to assess drainage and differential renal function in patients who become pain free after pyeloplasty for UPJO may not be necessary.

        "answer": "Most GPs apply ANAES guidelines and order plasma creatinine assays. However, there is a discrepancy between how the physician \"perceives\" the seriousness of the renal insufficiency and a more objective measure based on the CCR figure. It would seem that the CCR derivative is insufficiently exploited despite the widespread availability of converters. Thus, the PHENOMEN survey has revealed that the extent of renal involvement in patients with hypertension still tends to be underestimated by GPs despite the major implications of this complication in terms of therapeutic strategy and global cardiovascular risk.",
